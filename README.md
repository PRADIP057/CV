THIS REPOSITORY CONTAIN PROJECT RELATED TO COMPUTER VISION
# Flower Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a flower detection system using the Xception model, a deep learning architecture known for its excellent performance on image classification tasks. The goal is to accurately classify and detect various types of flowers from input images.

## Features

- **Xception Model:** Utilized the pre-trained Xception model for image classification tasks.
- **Flower Dataset:** Trained the model on a dataset containing diverse images of flowers('daisy', 'dandelion', 'roses', 'sunflowers', 'tulips').
- **Accuracy Metrics:** Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Incorporated visualizations to showcase model predictions and performance metrics.
- **Inference:** Provided a mechanism for making predictions on new flower images.
